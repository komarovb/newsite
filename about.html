            I'm a software developer with a background in clinical imaging and a strong interest in building robust systems that have real-world impact. I currently work at <a href="{{ site.data.homepage.radialis_link | escape }}" target="_blank" class="external-link">Radialis</a>, where I develop software for organ-targeted PET scanners. My work spans the full stack—from low-level hardware interfaces and CUDA-accelerated image reconstruction algorithms to cloud infrastructure, CI pipelines, and automated testing.

            I enjoy getting to the bottom of complex issues—debugging, experimenting, and understanding systems deeply. I also take pride in collaboration and mentorship. Helping teammates grow and succeed is one of the most rewarding parts of my work.

            Outside of my day job, I find solace in the programmer-friendliness and expressiveness of <img src="/assets/images/ruby_icon.png" class="icon-image" alt="Ruby programming language icon"> Ruby. I enjoy building small tools that solve practical problems—though my favorite side projects still call me “Dad.”

            Looking ahead, I'm eager to deepen my experience with large-scale systems in domains that create meaningful change—whether in healthcare, safety, or applied AI. I'm a generalist at heart, and I thrive at the intersection of systems, people, and purpose.
